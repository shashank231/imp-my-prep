# üß† TL;DR:
# You're absolutely correct: threading doesn‚Äôt help with CPU-bound tasks in Python because of the GIL.
# re.search() is CPU-bound, and threads don‚Äôt run in parallel (in CPython).
# So, Python threads won't speed up CPU-bound search ‚Äî and won‚Äôt improve time complexity either.


# ‚úÖ If you want true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks, use multiprocessing, not threading.
# ‚úÖ So Why Did We Use Threads Then?
# Mainly because:
    # It's simpler to explain concurrency and thread-safe access patterns.
    # If you imagine:
        # The documents were coming in at runtime
        # The searching operation was I/O-bound (e.g., reading large files from disk or network)
        # ...then threads would help.
    # But you're 100% right ‚Äî in our current example:
        # All documents are in memory
        # Search is re.search (CPU-bound string scanning)
        # No file or network I/O
        # ‚û°Ô∏è So threading doesn't help ‚Äî and might even add slight overhead.
