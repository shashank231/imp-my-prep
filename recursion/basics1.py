# Recursion
# Whenever you think you have to take some descisions from some available choices

# IP/OP method

# Base condition + Hypothesis + Induction

# When Recursion is finalized
# Think solution is incrementally possible or not, like in LCS then we can solve like LCS return inside solution 1 + recn()
# If solution is not incrementally possible, like in LCSub then we need to keep continuity, so we will track solution in function arg, and 
# return answer from basecase

# Recursion
# Always validate what you are calling
# validations are very important in recursion
# eg. tree me node.left pe recursion call karne se pehle check if node.left is there or not itself **
